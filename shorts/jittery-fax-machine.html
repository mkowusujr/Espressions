<p>“Uhm,” I say as my mind buffers and loads its next response. “Hi, Bethany. What’s wrong?” I allow the words to fall out mouth gentle like helicopter seeds. I tried to be straightforward hoping said get to a straightforward answer, but instead of a one sentence response, I got a novel. Guess this is how it feels when teachers want a one-page essay and get a packet.</p><p>“So, the other day I was sitting in class when announcements came on,” she began, setting up her story. “You know the youzhes, the pledge, followed by silence and a news flash. Well, they were talking about the Football game and h-how, ya know it’s this Saturday...” The words seemed to jam as the tried to leave her mouth. She was acting like a broken fax machine, red, overheating and producing some strange robotic noises. I kind of felt the need to just interrupt her before she exploded.</p><p>“Do you want to go to the game with me?” I might take hours get a knock joke, or miss all the potential signs that a girl like me, but I know when an acquaintance wants to hang out. She malfunctions; drops her luggage onto the floor and erupts into bright giggles. Glad to see she was happy, but I needed her to finish quickly. I was already running late to class and my girlfriend was waiting for me in the library.</p>
