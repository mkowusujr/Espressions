<p>Andrea had finally managed to escape the office with her parcel, and hid, breathing hard, behind a dumpster in an alley, and listened as her pursuers ran past, shouting orders at each other. She could barely breath from running so hard, and she was sure they could hear her gasping for air, or even her heartbeat thudding in her own ears. But no, they ran past, and Andrea was safe... for the next couple of seconds, at least.</p><p>She glanced down at the small item in her hands. <em>This is it? This is what all this is for?</em> Carl was going to be thrilled. She, on the other hand, was furious. She&#39;d practically gotten herself killed, still <em>might</em> get herself killed... and for <em>what</em>? It was so senseless.</p><p>She was strongly tempted to just take the stupid thing and throw it in the Hudson. Let Carl rage - <em>he</em> was sitting safely at home, waiting for her to do all the dirty work for him!</p><p>Having finally caught her breath, she looked around for where to go next. Dumpster, alley, leading to streets in both directions. And a few fire escapes. She could go to the rooftops. But that was probably the first place <em>they</em> were looking.</p><p>But it was either the fire escape, or the street. Or, she could just stay here behind the dumpster and hope that nobody looked there. She was still weighing those three options when she heard the footsteps. A single set of footsteps, coming down the alleyway towards her.</p><p><code>	</code>﻿Andrea figures it&#39;s too late now to run to the fire escape or the street. Not leaving in her best opinion. She zips her jacket all the way to neck length then pulls it over her nose. By now the stench of rotten leftovers and broken electronics is distracting her ability to think of an escape plan. She picked up the sounds of fingerprints on the dumpster and muffled voices, she quickly dives into the ocean of garbage out of sight. She from her rest spot she sees a crack of light piecing from a tiny opening. And just as fast as it opens it closed. They probably couldn’t hand the scent unlike Andrea, she’s lived her whole life with smelly men. From being crowded in a small two-bedroom apartment with three other athletic teenage brothers, to living with this cowardly snob Carl. </p><p><code>    </code>Carl would receive a fist full of rotten leftovers as a bonus for the o-so special parcel. She questioned this whole mission in frustration. Why is she even wasting time doing this for Carl, her deadbeat boyfriend? At the time they dated they were still in junior high. Young, in love, full withed with ambition and passion, not knowing the future would let them down.  Carl ended up becoming a cybersecurity agent and a bug firm and Andrea, well she focused on graphic design and her gymnastics scholarship. As time went on Carl became too content, he did things half-heartedly, eventually; he loved Andrea the same. Yet she stuck around why? Maybe, he’ll change she thought.</p><p><code>    </code>Eventually, he lost his job, and the rent was right around the corner. Carl was pushed to the edge, his whole life was about to flush down the drain. He was an ant about to be crushed, gaining to will to persevere, however not in the most… legal way. He thought including Andrea in his scheme would help bring them closer. </p><p><code>    </code>After camping out for several minutes, Andrea lifted the dumpster lid and hopped out. The coast was clear. She made her way down the street, Carls apartment was only a couple blocks away. Dispute smelling like complete dog feces, she felt self-congratulatory for being able to evade her pursuers. She goes to part herself on her back when a large, thick, dark hand grabbed mine.</p><p><code>    </code>“Lemme helps you with that,” said a larger man in a black suit and tie. Andrea froze in shook, her pursuers were onto to her the whole time. Just like an octopus, she made herself disappear. In a matter of seconds, she was gone. Andrea bolted onto a heavy populated sidewalk, pushing past civilians trying to lose the last purser in the crowd. Left, Right, Right, Left, she makes unpredictable frantic turns at the edge of blocks trying to confuse him. But it&#39;s not working, as she is leaving a trail of sweat and fear behind her.</p><p><code>    </code>Just as hope is lost, Andrea trips on a pebble and tumbles down a hill. Crashing and falling into a pile of leaves at the local park. Apparently, that accident was enough to lose him. Andrea picks up the parcel of the ground, surprisingly still in good condition. </p><p><code>    </code>She arrives at her apartment looking like she was hit by a car then tossed into a landfill. She drops the parcel right next to Carl’s desk. He looks up from his computer to see his angry battered up girlfriend. “Oh yeah! Good job baby now was a step closer to solving all our problems” he says excitedly. </p><p><code>    </code>“It better be, because you’re about to have another one”, Andrea says as she crosses her arms. Carl gets up and picks up the parcel, opening it to reveal another smaller box. He picks it up with a huge smile on his face. Andrea is even more frustrated, she did not risk just her life to bring Carl a little box! But as Carl stands up and knees with the box held high, Andrea’s angry vanishes. </p><p><code>    </code>“Baby I understand the past few years haven’t been the best. I’ve lost my touch but seeing you work so hard to keep us going inspired me. I want to make up for those lackluster years. I’ve been secretly getting my life together, got a job, lost weight. All the things we didn’t do. I love Andrea Jackson. Will you give me a chance and marry me?” </p><p><code>    </code>“Y-y-yes I do!” Andrea says as she fills to room with moist passionate tears. The too hug and makeup.</p><p><code>    </code>“Look before you get mad at me for making you go throw all that I just want to say it was all planned. Those guys are friends from my new job, I knew you would recognize them haha. This whole pursuit was inspired by our favorite movie growing up, The Chase featuring John Jones. We had so many good moments in that movie, I thought emulating it would be fun for you” Carl explain as he helps Andrea slip into something less… disgusting.</p><p><code>    </code>“It’s okay honey, you’re going to pay for my hair, nails, spa day, and new clothes. You are going to make up for this,” she says with a devious smile. Oh, Carl, you’d think a gift card or a mini surprise party would’ve been a smarter idea.</p>
