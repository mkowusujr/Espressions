I usually thought that everyone had a special person made for them,  
The Eve to their Adam.  
The matching puzzle piece that completes them,  
The yin to their yang.  
  
I thought life was all about finding that soul mate,  
There are billions of humans on this planet.  
The thought of finding my soul mate felt like looking for a needle in a haystack,  
I became very discouraged.  
  
When it comes to love people say you just know when you found the one,  
Some signal goes off in your heart when your true love is detected.  
Well, my soul mate radar must be on the fitz,  
Many times I thought I found true love, and many times they wanted nothing to do with me romantically.
  
What is the ideal partner?  
Is it someone who you have a lot in common with?  
Is it someone who is your polar opposite?  
There doesn't seem to be a common census here.  
  
I've been looking for love like water in the desert,  
My heart longs for it in this barren land.  
That's when it came to me,  
I've had blindfolds over my eyes this entire time.  
  
My soul mate isn't some manufactured person waiting for me at the end of my search,  
They are my partner in life, they weren't created to meet my needs,  
But through their love, they have come to want to help me.  

To help me see things in my blind spots,  
They are the person who I am willing to fight for,  
The one I'm willing to work things out with,  
The one I'm willing to lay down my life for.  

My heart alone didn't teach me that or show me this,  
It was only when I mean you that I realize I want to make this work,  
I will fight against my selfishness because I love you and want to keep loving you.
