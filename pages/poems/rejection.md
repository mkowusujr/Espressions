I always felt like I didn't fit in,  
This became all more clear when my brothers finally had their way.  

My people have a rigid class system,  
If you resemble the bottom of the totem you're treated like dirt.  
My brothers walked all over me growing up,  
They were royalty and I was a peasant lucky to share the same air they breathed.  

Father continued to shine forth his love for me,  
But all I felt was the cold mocks from my siblings.  

They poked fun at my height, my frailties, and my shortcomings,  
They could move boulders by the will of their minds,  
And I was lucky if I could nudge a pebble.  
They had tens of wives and 100 hundreds of children.  
I just had no one to call my own.  

But Father continued to shine forth his love for me,  
Yet all I felt was the cold mocks from my siblings.  

Our Father has the highest authority among our people,  
He was a great conqueror and a fierce lover.  
He had a great love for his children,  
He gave each of them their own planet to rule when they became of age.

And I looked forward to the day I'd reach that age,  
The day the family's ugly duckling would become a swan,  
But my brothers had their way.  

I always felt I didn't fit in,  
And they made that feeling a reality.  
They used their influence to cause an uproar amongst our people at the thought of me,  
Little ol me becoming a ruler.  

They convinced my father's advisors that I was a mistake and didn't belong,  
And when my father retired and handed over power to my brothers,  
They cast me out of my own home.  
No longer could I feel my father's love,  
Just resentment for my siblings.
