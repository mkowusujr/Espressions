She's been here for a couple of years now.  
Reliable and hard-working she has risen in rank.  
But with that came greater responsibility.  
It is her $5^{th}$ night shift this week.  
You can tell she holds back her groans of agony and shields her complaints through cherry eyes and her warm inviting Colgate smile.  
Every once in a while, you catch her mask start to slip.

She is as bitter as dark chocolate.  
All the customer complaints all the unreasonable demands from corporate,  
All the bills that she anxiously dwells on each night have left her with very little reason to have a sugary outlook on things.  
Not a day goes by that she doesn't want to quit, But where else can she would she go? And she has people depending on her, So she has no choice but to burn out.
