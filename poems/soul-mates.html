<p>I usually thought that everyone had a special person made for them<br>The Eve to their Adam<br>The matching puzzle piece that completes them<br>The ying to their yang  </p><p>I thought life was all about finding that soul mate<br>There are billions of humans on this planet<br>The thought of finding my soul mate felt like looking for a needle in a haystack<br>I became very discouraged  </p><p>When it comes to love people say you just know when you found the one<br>Some signal goes off in your heart when you true love is detected<br>Well my soul mate radar must be on the fitz<br>Many times I thought I found true love, and many times they wanted nothing to do   with me romantically</p><p>What is the ideal partner?<br>Is it someone who you have a lot in common with<br>Is it someone who is your polar opposite<br>There doesn&#39;t seem to be a common census here  </p><p>I&#39;ve been looking for love like water in the dessert<br>My heart longs for it and this barren land<br>That&#39;s when it came to me<br>I&#39;ve had blind folds over my eyes this entire time  </p><p>My soul mate isn&#39;t some manufactured person waiting for me at the end of my search<br>They are my partner in life, they weren&#39;t created to meet my needs<br>But through their love they have come to want to help me<br>To help me see things in my blind spots<br>They are the person who I am willing to fight for<br>I&#39;m willing to work things out with<br>Willing to lay down my life for<br>My heart alone didn&#39;t teach me that or show me this<br>It was only when I mean you that I realize I want to make this work<br>I will fight against my selfishness because I love you and want to keep loving you  </p>
