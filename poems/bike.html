<p>Bike riding is a child&#39;s rite of passage<br>Gather up all your grown-up friends, I&#39;m sure they can ride a bike<br>They know what its like to feel the wind on their skin like a kite,<br>Being free and light, nimble like water as they swerve around obstacles  </p><p>I am an outliner<br>I am full of embarrassment and regret<br>I am chained on the ground<br>Bounded by the fear of falling  </p><p>You see he that keeps me imprison<br>He has kept me from learning to ride a bike<br>Each time I try is like trying not to fall off a tightrope  </p><p>Doubt and Anxiety remind me again that I&#39;m going to fail<br>So give in I might as well<br>My friend had empathy for me, she showed me a simpler way  </p><p>&quot;If you&#39;re not ready to run, then waddle like a toddler<br>Paddle your feet along the ground and try to steer<br>This will help you improve your balance dear&quot; </p><p>Slowly and steadily I had no more fears<br>As my confidence increased I stretched myself to higher levels<br>Like a child finally figuring out how to walk and run about<br>The muscle memory became ingrained and the skill was now simple and plane<br>After all that trial and error, it clicked it was there<br>Im free now fear! I can pedal anywhere  </p>
