<h3>SCENE I - The Monsters</h3><p><span class="italic">The curtains open to reveal a makeshift hut made of sticks and bushes at the center of the stage. All around the hut are the burnt ruins of larger huts. Next to the hutt about 3 feet away is a campfire that is providing light to the stage. There is dust and ash everywhere. There is a pale, dark-haired, pointed-ear teenage girl kneeling beside the hut. She is wearing worn-out baggy clothing and a large sunhat. The inside of the hut is visible, and the parts of her skin that are visible are covered in ash. In the hut is a pale, dark-haired, pointed-ear, teenage boy. He is wearing similar attire to the girl and also has ash and dust on his skin. He has clothed bandages wrapping around his left leg. The girl gets on all fours and crawls into the hutt and sits beside the boy. She begins to gently tap him.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>SELENA</h4><p>Wake up, Nico! Wake up my hermanito!</p></div><p><span class="italic">NICOLAS grunts and starts to stretch while laying down.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>SELENA CONT.</h4><p>Get up little brother, the sun is down, it's finally nighttime!</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>NICOLAS</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">Whilst rubbing his eyes</span>)</p><p>Thanks for waking me up hermana. Were you able to get any sleep this morning?</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>SELENA</h4><p>Only a couple of hours. (Pauses to run the calculations in her head.) Yeah, no more than 4 hours.</p></div><p><span class="italic">A sad expression colors NICOLAS' face.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>SELENA CONT.</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">With a smile on her face</span>)</p><p>It's been hard for me to fall asleep since the vampire hunters attacked our family's settlement five days ago. During the day I feel an overwhelming urge to stay up and keep guard to make sure no more vampire hunters come back around to finish what they started around here.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>NICOLAS</h4><p>I don't care about those savage humans. I just care about your health Lena. You and I both know that's not enough sleep. You're a growing teenager, you need your rest.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>SELENA</h4><p>I know I know. Tranquilo, don't worry about me Nico. I'll be fine. I just- I just want to make sure you're safe. I don't care what happens to me. You're all I have. I don't want to lose you like we lost Ma and Pa to the vampire hunters five days ago.</p></div><p><span class="italic">NICOLAS goes to hug his sister.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>NICOLAS</h4><p>Te amo, I love you, and I'm not going anywhere. Not without a fight this time. So don't worry about me, I hate seeing my hermana sad and scared, it makes me feel sad and helpless. I want to cheer you up and make you feel like you don't have to carry this burden all by yourself.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>SELENA</h4><p>Sorry for making you feel that way. I'm just trying my best to be a mother figure to you. I don't know how to do this right. I wish I still had more time with Ma.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>NICOLAS</h4><p>Right now, I just want you to be my sister. We can figure out the rest once we get out of this graveyard.</p></div><p><span class="italic">NICOLAS gives his sister a tight bear hug and begins to stand up and walks with a slight limp out of the hut.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>SELENA</h4><p>How's your leg holding up Nico?<br />NICOLAS<br />Like twenty times better!</p></div><p><span class="italic">NICOLAS begins to run around the stage.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>SELENA</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">Looking downcast</span>)</p><p>Sorry, I wasn't able to get us to safety without you getting injured during the vampire hunter's assault.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>NICOLAS</h4><p>Hermana, stop apologizing. I hold nothing against you big sis! I'm just glad we are both alive.</p></div><p><span class="italic">NICOLAS begins doing jumping jacks. SELENA walks out of the hut as well and stands beside him.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>SELENA</h4><p>Now that you're feeling better, are you ready to start heading over to the location of the Monster Helper Senior Gideon Kiesel?</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>NICOLAS</h4><p>Yeah! I can't wait to meet Senior Gideon Kiesel!</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>SELENA</h4><p>Me too. Now that Ma, Pa, and the others are gone he is the only adult I can trust. Now help me put out the campfire before we leave.</p></div><p><span class="italic">SELENA and NICOLAS go to the edge of the stage to grab an armful of mud to put the fire out with.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>NICOLAS</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">Whilst picking up mud</span>)</p><p>I must've been really young the last time we saw him, cause I don't really remember what he looks like.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>SELENA</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">Chuckles whilst picking up mud</span>)</p><p>Of course, you were no older than 2 years old. Luckily for me, I was 6 years old, so even a decade later I still have faint memories of him.</p></div><p><span class="italic">SELENA and NICOLAS listen to the crackle of the fire for a moment. They look at the fire and look around themselves at all the debris around them. Then they look back at the fire and take a deep breath. They then throw the mud from their arms into the fireplace and watch as the fire dies down. NICOLAS turns his head to see the gloomy expression on his sister's face. He begins to look up slightly trying to come up with ideas to brighten her mood.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>NICOLAS</h4><p>So what was he like? Why did everyone call him the monster helper?</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>SELENA</h4><p>Because even though he was human, he didn't dedicate his life to hunting us down. Ever since the industrial revolution began, there has been an increase in monster hunters. That's one of the reasons why our pack is nomadic. Unfortunately for us, it looks like we stayed here too long and the humans caught sight of us. Senior Gideon Kiesel is sympathetic and treats our kind with dignity and compassion. He's the man who rescued Ma from some hunters when she was young.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>NICOLAS</h4><p>Now that I'm big and strong I can't wait to meet him!</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>SELENA</h4><p>Before we go, let's pay our respects to our deceased family. This will probably be the last time we come here. This place is no longer safe.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>NICOLAS</h4><p>After 6 months of living in this settlement, it was finally starting to feel like home. I hate how we always have to keep moving around, I wish we could stay a little longer.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>SELENA</h4><p>The feelings are mutual hermanito, but we have to go. Honestly, we are lucky that we were able to regain our strength five days after the attack.</p></div><p><span class="italic">SELENA and NICOLAS walk over to the leftmost side of the stage which contains several piles of dirt with wooden crosses sticking out from all of the piles of dirt. The two somberly stare at the grave. There is silence for a whole minute.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>NICOLAS</h4><p>I still can't believe how fast everything changed. I can't believe they're all gone too.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>SELENA</h4><p>Sometimes I ask myself, why were we the only ones to survive? That feels so cruel. To live and be surrounded by the dead bodies of everyone you loved.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>NICOLAS</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">Breaks out in tears</span>)</p><p>They think we are monsters, but we have done nothing! We have done nothing to them.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>SELENA</h4><p>Even though that's true, you know why the humans attacked our village. Our ancestors really made a negative impact on them. They fed off them. They kidnapped their loved ones and infected them with our disease. Even though our family and pack have sworn to the Chupacabra Oath to only feast on animals, the humans can't tell the difference between us and human-feasting fiends like the Glouls.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>NICOLAS</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">Starts to pout</span>)</p><p>We do not have a disease.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>SELENA</h4><p>Come on hermanito. If we weren't diseased why does mother nature hate us? We can't go into the sun without burning. We need a constant supply of the blood of living things to survive.</p></div><p><span class="italic">NICOLAS covers her pointy ears and shakes her head frantically.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>NICOLAS</h4><p>Sometimes you sound like them! You are a vampire, be proud of our ancestry!</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>SELENA</h4><p>I never said I wasn't, I was just pointing out the facts. It's not a surprise that the humans attacked us. Now that they have made technological advancements they feel ready to finally get their revenge.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>NICOLAS</h4><p>But still, why attack a peaceful village? We were defenseless.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>SELENA</h4><p>That's exactly the reason why they attacked this village. It was to send a message to the more hostile vampire factions. Get in line. Or see what becomes of your home, your family, your possessions.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>NICOLAS</h4><p>Curse those factions. I don't even consider them as one of us. Those stupid bottom-feeding ghouls. Their refusal to let go of such a dated practice has cost us everything. And for what? Human blood is disgusting.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>SELENA</h4><p>I don't disagree. When I asked our great great great grandfather when his generation stopped drinking human blood, he said partially it was because humans started living like drugged pigs. Filling their bodies with sugar and weird chemicals Their blood became a repulsive chemical soup that was making us sick.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>NICOLAS</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">Whilst running his eyes</span>)</p><p>And yet those ghouls continue to eat that up.</p></div><p><span class="italic">SELENA and NICOLAS share a laugh.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>SELENA</h4><p>Well, I think it's time we start heading over to Senior Kiesel's house. From what I remember it's a solid 20 miles away. I think we can easily cover more ground if we transform into our dog form to give us a boost of stamina.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>NICOLAS</h4><p>Alright! Let's go to Senior Kiesel's house!</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>SELENA</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">Looking seriously into her brother's eyes</span>)</p><p>And if we run into those vampire hunters again, I promise hermanito, I won't let those monsters hurt you.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>NICOLAS</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">Smiles</span>)</p><p>I know you won't.</p></div><h3>SCENE II - The Hunters</h3><p><span class="italic">The curtains open to the interior of a log cabin. The walls reflect the warm orangish color of the tungsten bulbs that hang from the tall ceiling. The oak floor is clothed with the hide of a wolf. There are two large wooden desks in the room. One is by the door which is facing west of the stage. There is another desk on the eastern side of the stage. There is a fancy curved rocking chair at this desk. This well-filed and organized desk is free of clutter and mess. And at this desk is seated a man approaching middle age. FELIX WOLF. He is wearing his leather boots and gloves. His trench coat is still on him. His cowboy hat is still hugging his forward head. He has a Baselard, a short sword, in his left hand. In his right hand, he has a sandpaper cloth. He is sharpening his weapon. Above his head is a poster of the legendary vampire hunter Roland Stone. The cabin door swings open and in walks a woman in her late twenties. She is wearing knee-high boots, vintage mom jeans, and an oversized sweatshirt. She has large hooped earrings dangling from her ear lobes. Her dirty blond hair is done in a bob style. She is holding an envelope in her left hand, and a ridiculously large shopping bag in her right.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>NADIA</h4><p>You're still in that same chair, sharpening that same knife huh-</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>FELIX</h4><p>It's called a Baselard, and issa sword, not a knife.</p></div><p><span class="italic">FELIX briefly looks up at NADIA and then immediately goes back to sharpening his blade.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>NADIA</h4><p>Potato, potahto. I get this is our job and all and that we have to be good at it, but come on man, live a little. You have got to stop rejecting my offers to go shopping together.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>FELIX</h4><p>Life's more than blowing money on material possessions.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>NADIA</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">Acts shocked and speaking sarcastically</span>)</p><p>Ouch, (puts hand with the shopping bag over her chest) that really hurts Fe.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>FELIX</h4><p>I thought I told ya not to call me that.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>NADIA</h4><p>Come on Fe, lighten up, we've been co-workers for 8 years now. I think we should be on a nickname basis now.</p></div><p><span class="italic">Felix sighs, puts the knife blade down along with a cleaning wipe, and gets up out of his chair.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>FELIX</h4><p>Fine, you're lucky I'm in a good mood. What was that childish name you wanted me to call ya... (Begins scratching head) Was it Naddy?</p></div><p><span class="italic">NADIA puts the shopping bag on the floor and the envelope on a nearby desk, while sighing.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>NADIA</h4><p>No, it was Dia. Come on Fe, you're only 32 yet you act like a decrepit old man sometimes. I literally have to constantly remind you to call me Dia.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>FELIX</h4><p>Watch your tone wit me Nadia.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>NADIA</h4><p>DIA! Come on, we are supposed to be on a nickname basis!</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>FELIX</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">Signs and facepalms</span>)</p><p>Whatever, anyways what did you waste your cut of the commission on this time (He points to NADIA's bags), and what's with those papers ya walked in with?</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>NADIA</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">Grabbing the shopping bag and making a puppy dog face</span>)</p><p>Oh, this thingy?! Remember that new pair of heels that Baelina Williams just released?</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>FELIX</h4><p>Don't tell me you actually wasted money on those ugly things. (Sighs and slaps his face)</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>NADIA</h4><p>I DID!</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>FELIX</h4><p>Those are like a thousand dollars. That's your whole cut of the commission. Ya need to be more wise with your money.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>NADIA</h4><p>Come down, you act like I'm going to go broke. Vampires and monsters aren't going extinct yet. Humanity has only recently started killing them off. And as long as there are monsters wreaking havoc on humanity, there will be some fool desperate enough to pay us to kill them off.</p></div><p><span class="italic">She smiles and begins to pull out the most hideous fuzzy shoes you've ever seen</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>FELIX</h4><p>This is more than just a job ya know.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>NADIA</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">In a mocking tone</span>)</p><p>Yeah, yeah, it's more than a job, it's a privilege, an honorable service to our country. (<span class="italic">Speaking normally</span>) You've told me at least a thousand times.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>FELIX</h4><p>And yet it seems I am not able to penetrate the stubborn soil that is your skull.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>NADIA</h4><p>Are you trying to hurt my feelings today? If you keep going, you might actually make me cry this time (She smirks).</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>FELIX</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">Sighs and slaps his face</span>)</p><p>I'm not trying to hurt your feelings. It's just I wish ya would take this job more seriously. The foes we fight are not to be trifled with.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>NADIA</h4><p>The vampires? Those vermin don't frighten me at all. I just see them as no more than pests that we get paid the big bucks to deal with.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>FELIX</h4><p>Is that all you see of this job? We're a bunch of overpaid exterminators?</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>NADIA</h4><p>You said it, not me. But I totally agree.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>FELIX</h4><p>I fear for your generation.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>NADIA</h4><p>You know you're only four years apart from me, right? We are from the same generation, dummy.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>FELIX</h4><p>Vampires are more than just mosquitos and ticks. They are vicious cold-blooded heartless freaks of nature. If we don't kill them they will kill us. We have centuries of history to show us that. They are cunning and smart. Those mutts possess sentience and a form of intelligence that allows those monsters to compete with us.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>NADIA</h4><p>Okay and?</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>FELIX</h4><p>I lost my mother to those beasts. For centuries, all of humanity has been on the losing side of the fight for dominance and security against these demonic creatures for far too long. Thanks to the industrial revolution and our technological advancements we can finely hurt them back. And I will refuse to sit back and watch a generation of careless people grow up. A naive person has a false sense of safety. You feel safe and like this job is light work because of people like me. People like the legendary Roland Stone, who sacrifice their lives to make the world a better place.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>NADIA</h4><p>You really don't know much about me after all these years. Do you pay attention to anything I say? I'm not just some naive girl. I grew up with no parents because vampires were killed. I had to raise my two baby brothers all by myself by begging for scraps. When I learned how lucrative and rewarding the vampire hunting industry was, I trained myself to become a cleaning machine so that my brothers and I could have an easy life because our childhood was a pile of crap!</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>FELIX</h4><p>I'm sorry, sorry for making so many assumptions about you. I'm so used to watching you acting so vain, I forget about the life you came from.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>NADIA</h4><p>Dang Fe, the stone-hearted man is finally apologizing, I must have really hit a soft spot for you. I'm not used to seeing you emote.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>FELIX</h4><p>It just pains me to see you act careless. You almost hurt yourself badly two days ago.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>NADIA</h4><p>Yeah, but I didn't get hurt (smiles), you forgot I graduated top of my class from the academy. I know I plan it too close for your comfort, but it's the only way I can keep myself from getting bored. Our tools make this job easier.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>FELIX</h4><p>Whatever, just be more careful. You know how much I've been through, I lost my loved ones to those monsters so when I see you being dainty and giddy on the battlefield it triggers memories of my dying family for me.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>NADIA</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">Putting hands on her cheeks</span>)</p><p>Awww Fe, did you finally admit that you love me?</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>FELIX</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">With an emotionless expression</span>)</p><p>Ya are literally every red flag I avoid in women.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>NADIA</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">Laughs</span>)</p><p>Whatever you say Fe, I know you find me irresistible. I mean who wouldn't?</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>FELIX</h4><p>Whatever Dia, anyways ya never answered my question. What's with the envelope?</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>NADIA</h4><p>Awww, you finally called me by my nickname. Looks like pouring your heart out was all you needed.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>FELIX</h4><p>Can ya stay focused for once?</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>NADIA</h4><p>Fine fine, calm down buzz kill. While I was shopping, I got a call to pick up from the Mayor's security about a new assignment.</p></div><p><span class="italic">FELIX's eyes come back to life, he leans forward in his chair eager to hear what NADIA has to say.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>NADIA</h4><p>Apparently, people have spotted smoke coming from the ruins of the vampire village we attacked 2 days ago. They think we messed up a spot and that there might be survivors trying to regain their strength. We are to right to the ruins and kill any survivors immediately.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>FELIX</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">With an unamused expression</span>)</p><p>I told ya not to leave any stone left unturned.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>NADIA</h4><p>Don't put all the blame on me Fe, you said it yourself, these cunning vermin are somehow as smart as us.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>FELIX</h4><p>Whatever, grab up stuff, and get ready by 5. I'll get our rides ready.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>NADIA</h4><p>5 minutes is not enough time! I need to shower and fix my hair and iron my clothes.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>FELIX</h4><p>Ya have 5 minutes, if those vampires harm any of the towns folk you'll have their blood on your hands.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>NADIA</h4><p>Fine buzz kill. But believe me, when we get back home, I am going to hog the shower for at least two hours to make you suffer in your sweat and stinkiness like you're doing to me now.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>FELIX</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">Sigh and shakes his head</span>)</p><p>You're so childish.</p></div><p><span class="italic">FELIX gets up and heads out the door. NADIA pouts and crosses her arms.</span></p><h3>SCENE III - The Hunt</h3><p><span class="italic">The curtains open to reveal the woods. The background of the stage is populated by trees. The night sky is dark yet shines bright thanks to the illuminations of numerous stars. The middle of the stages is clear of trees. In comes the orphans from the east onto the stage. They are in dog customs and walking on all fours.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>NICOLAS</h4><p>Are we there yet?</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>SELENA</h4><p>I'd say about 10 more minutes.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>NICOLAS</h4><p>Hey Lena, do you hear that?</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>SELENA</h4><p>I don't hear anything suspicious, but I am picking up a familiar perfume. Lavender.</p></div><div class="dual-dialogue"><div class="dialogue left"><h4>NICOLAS</h4><p>OH NO, IT'S THE HUNTERS!</p></div><div class="dialogue right"><h4>SELENA</h4><p>OH NO, IT'S THE HUNTERS!</p></div></div><p><span class="italic">FELIX and NADIA rush onto the stage.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>FELIX</h4><p>Ya cursed beasts sure have a good sense of smell, but that won't save ya.</p></div><p><span class="italic">FELIX unsheathes his blade and runs towards SELENA.</span></p><p><span class="italic">SELENA swings her tail and goes to punch her face.</span></p><p><span class="italic">NICOLAS catches his fist through!</span></p><p><span class="italic">SELENA uses the opportunity to swing her body and knock FELIX over with her tail</span></p><p><span class="italic">NADIA laughs at FELIX.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>FELIX</h4><p>Are ya just going to stand there and watch me get my butt whooped? Come over and help me, lazy bones.</p></div><p><span class="italic">NADIA dashes toward the vampire orphans. She pulls out short daggers from her waist.</span></p><p><span class="italic">She swings her arms with precision.</span></p><p><span class="italic">Her swings make contact with SELENA's scales, but SELENA is unfazed.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>SELENA</h4><p>Nico, run off into the trees, and I'll take care of this!</p></div><p><span class="italic">NICOLAS hops off SELENA's back and runs off the stage.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>FELIX</h4><p>Oh no ya don't</p></div><p><span class="italic">FELIX begins to chase after NICOLAS but gets his leg grabbed by SELENA.</span></p><p><span class="italic">SELENA yanks him to the ground and begins to pin him in place. She goes to bite him.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>FELIX</h4><p>DO IT! I dare you. Ya freak of nature!</p></div><p><span class="italic">SELENA is taken aback and hesitates.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>SELENA</h4><p>I'm not a freak of nature!</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>NADIA</h4><p>You say that, yet you are in the form of a dog with a terrible case of mange.</p></div><p><span class="italic">SELENA looks at her arms.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>SELENA</h4><p>I'm only in this form to protect my brother from you monsters. You guys took everything from us, and yet you aren't satisfied!</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>FELIX</h4><p>Look who's talking. The cursed blood-sucking demon calling whose kind has haunted humanity for years is accusing me of doing the same. What I am doing is justice. Did your kind really think they could get away with their crimes?</p></div><p><span class="italic">NADIA grabs SELENA from behind and throws her to the ground.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>FELIX</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">Starts to get up</span>)</p><p>Ya sure took your time</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>NADIA</h4><p>I'm just trying to process how you're struggling to end a little kid.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>FELIX</h4><p>You know these creatures are stronger than they look!</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>SELENA</h4><p>Stop calling me a creature!</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>NADIA</h4><p>You won't want me to lie to your face kid? Sorry, but I speak my mind 24/7 and the truth is you're a disgusting vermin. We are not the same. You are an abomination, a freak of nature.</p></div><p><span class="italic">SELENA begins to shed a tear.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>NADIA</h4><p>Did Dia hurt your feelings?</p></div><p><span class="italic">SELENA goes to bite NADIA but gets punched in the throat by FELIX. SELENA stumbles back a bit. She is staggered.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>FELIX</h4><p>Ya vampires are creatures of lust and greed. Your ancestors couldn't accept reality. They couldn't accept death. They tried to cheat it and lost their humanity. Children of the cursed. Even the sun can't stand the sight of you.

On the left-hand side of the stage is a living room. The wall containing the living door is placed in the center of the stage. The living room is decorated with hundreds of colorful books supported by beautiful wooden shelves with flowers carved in the corners. There is a bright red couch at the leftmost end of the stage, facing toward a fireplace. An old rugged man is sitting on the couch. He is wearing a collared polo and cargo shorts. In his hands is a necklace. On it are numerous beads, each with a name carved on it. He has a very solemn expression on his face.</span></p><p><span class="italic">On the right side of the stage are trees and bushes. The wilderness, the great unknown. Who knows the creatures that lurk in these woods?</span></p><p><span class="italic">Onto the stage comes SELENA wearing a wolf costume, and on her back is NICOLAS. SELENA talks of her wolf costume and stretches her limbs.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>SELENA</h4><p>We are finally here! We barely made it alive.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>NICOLAS</h4><p>You can say that again.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>SELENA</h4><p>Now I want you to be on your best behavior okay? Don't embarrass me in front of Senior Kiesel.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>NICOLAS</h4><p>Ew, you sound like Ma right now.</p></div><p><span class="italic">SELENA smiles and playful hits NICOLAS on the arm again. NICOLAS rubs his arm again to soothe the pain. ROLAND STONE hears the commotion going on outside and gets up and heads towards the door. He turns the knob and opens it.

He stands there in front of the do with his hands in his pockets.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>SELENA</h4><p>It's me Selena Lockwood and this is my brother Nicolas Lockwood. Remember us? We are the children of Sierra Katherines Lockwood.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ROLAND</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">Sniffles</span>)</p><p>So Sierra ended up safe after all.

And they are after us right now!</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>NICOLAS</h4><p>They figured out we survived.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ROLAND</h4><p>So you brought them to my house?! (<span class="italic">Looks outside his door frantically</span>). Are you trying to get me killed? I thought I told your kind that I was retiring from this lifestyle. I'm getting too old and weak to hide from the establishment. (<span class="italic">Sighs and facepalms</span>). Quick get inside.</p></div><p><span class="italic">SELENA and NICOLAS enter ROLAND's house.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>SELENA</h4><p>Are you going to help us, Senior Stone?</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>NICOLAS</h4><p>Please have mercy on us and help us.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>SELENA</h4><p>Our Madre always spoke kindly of you. She said amongst all of humanity you were one of the few to possess a sound mind and a compassionate heart.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ROLAND</h4><p>Look, I want to help you guys and all. But I'm getting too weak. I've had too many close calls in my youth. I can't keep this up any longer.

Have the hunters been after you too?</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ROLAND</h4><p>No. Not necessarily.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>SELENA</h4><p>Then what do you mean you've had too many close calls? Why did you retire?</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ROLAND</h4><p>Because. I'm a monster hunter-</p></div><p><span class="italic">SELENA and NICOLAS begin to hyperventilate.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>ROLAND</h4><p>Calm down you two and let me finish my sentence. I'm a monster hunter in the eyes of the law. You see, it is illegal to do what I've been doing for decades, harboring refugee monsters. I was only ever able to escape suspicion thanks to my cover as a monster hunter.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>SELENA</h4><p>You should've gotten to that part sooner! Are you trying to give me a heart attack?!</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ROLAND</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">Chuckles</span>)</p><p>For goodness sake, no. Sorry to scare you two.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>NICOLAS</h4><p>It's alright Senior Stone.

But the answer is love.</p></div><div class="dual-dialogue"><div class="dialogue left"><h4>SELENA</h4><p>You fell in love with a vampire?!</p></div><div class="dialogue right"><h4>NICOLAS</h4><p>You fell in love with a vampire?!</p></div></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ROLAND</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">Chuckles</span>)</p><p>I was a young man, (Stroking his gray beard). I was once blinded by society's point of view. That vampires were demonic creatures of the night. That they were heartless blood-sucking immoral monsters. I had friends who all had relatives that had been victims of vampire attacks.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>SELENA</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">Grumbles</span>)</p><p>Ghouls. It was those stupid ghouls, wasn't it?</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ROLAND</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">Chuckles</span>)</p><p>Yeah. It was. I didn't know that at the time. I didn't know that there were such diverse opinions on how to live within the vampire race.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>SELENA</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">Crossing her arms</span>)</p><p>Yeah, we don't all think the same.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ROLAND</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">Chuckles</span>)</p><p>You're right my friend, and it took falling in love to realize that. I joined the vampire-hunting division of the local militia. And I was good at it. I must've killed at least 50 vampires before I realize how wrong my actions are.</p></div><p><span class="italic">SELENA and NICOLAS gasp.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>ROLAND</h4><p>It was a cold dark night when I met Lucile. I was sent to investigate strange activity coming from an abandoned hospital. When I got there I saw a vampire caring for injured humans. Our undesirables. She, their enemy, was having compassion on them and nursed them back to love. It was then I realized everything I knew about these supposed heartless creatures was wrong.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>NICOLAS</h4><p>This doesn't have a happy ending, does it?</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ROLAND</h4><p>Depends on how you see it, my friend. I couldn't kill Lucile. She staged her death and took her in under my care. Using my status I was able to get the government to show compassion to the very undesirables they abandon. Over the years I spent with her, she taught me the history of your people. How mother nature herself cursed you guys with immortality at the cost of your humanity. You guys could live forever but needed an appetite for blood to sustain it. And when I realized that a majority of vampires decided to either live off just animal blood even though it was the most repulsive taste imaginable, or grow weak and die a natural death after decades of slowly decaying. It was then I realized we have killed more innocent pacifists.<br />Lucile was the one who encouraged me to become an advocate for the vampires. But I was too much of a coward to do it in the light. So under the guise of being publically known as Roland Stone the great Monster Hunter. I secretly became the Monster Helper. I took on more and more cases. If I could get to the vampires before my colleagues, I could fake their deaths and get them to safety. And for decades it worked.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>SELENA</h4><p>I don't get it then what happened to Lucile? Why did you retire?</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ROLAND</h4><p>We lived happily for 20 years. She was my partner in crime. I wanted us to start a family. But she didn't want to birth cursed children. I told her that I didn't care, we could make it work. I'd love those kids no matter their condition. But she feared for my reputation, she feared what would happen if it were discovered that the famous Vampire Hunter had half-vampire children. Over time people began to get suspicious of me. There were discrepancies in my work.<br />She knew that if I was caught I'd be charged with treason against my own race and given the death penalty. So she staged an attack on my workplace to try to vindicate my<br />crumbling reputation. She didn't tell me about it in advance. She orchestrated her death to be at my hands in front of my co-workers. She died in my arms. My co-workers were amazed by my cruelty in slaying her. It removed all their suspicions. But it wasn't me. I was under her hypnosis. She promised she would never take advantage of me in that manner. She lied. But she did it to protect me.<br />When I got home, broken and in tears, I discovered her letter. She was happy to die by my hands because she knew there was no hate in my heart. After that day I retired. At 45 years old I just wanted to be alone. I had taken the life of my love. I didn't want to see another human or vampire. I didn't want to be another cog in the machine that led to her death.<br />I'm sorry but I just can't help you guys. I've barely escaped suspicion all these years. I just want to be allowed and mourn Lucile.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>SELENA</h4><p>Do you think this is the life she wanted for you?</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ROLAND</h4><p>My friend, I've given the past of my years to the cause of protecting your kind.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>SELENA</h4><p>And I'm grateful. But there is still injustice in the world against our people. And you're one of the few people with a sound mind. With all due respect Senior Stone. Lucile died because you wanted to live a double life. You can't serve two masters. There comes a point in your life where you have to choose a side and plant your foot down. So what's it going to be?</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ROLAND</h4><p>I can't believe a child is trying to give me advice.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>SELENA</h4><p>I'm 57 years old. By human standards that's quite old.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ROLAND</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">Chuckles</span>)</p><p>Lucile was just as afraid as me. I'm living the very life she wanted me to live. Sheltered and in hiding. I'm living how she lived. In fear. The only life she knew.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>SELENA</h4><p>And look at where it has brought you too. Why must we continue to live like this?</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ROLAND</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">Sighs</span>)</p><p>Nicolas, your sister is wise beyond her appearances. Fine, I'll help you guys.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>NICOLAS</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">Smirking</span>)</p><p>Yeah, she gets it from me.</p></div><p><span class="italic">SELENA hits him on the arm. The two siblings laugh.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>SELENA</h4><p>Not just for tonight right Senior Stone?</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ROLAND</h4><p>Not just for tonight. You've challenged me. I'll come out of retirement to help you guys grow old to see adulthood. You guys won't have to hide after me and Lucile did.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>SELENA</h4><p>Awesome! So what's the plan, Senior Stone?</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ROLAND</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">With a large smile</span>)</p><p>First, we hide.</p></div><p><span class="italic">ROLAND chuckles.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>NICOLAS</h4><p>Is the plan really to run and hide for all your mortal life still? I thought we weren't going to do that.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>SELENA</h4><p>Nico, quit complaining, the man is doing the best he can to help us.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ROLAND</h4><p>Ouch, and no, we won't forever. I just needed to get those knucklehead hunters off your trail. Now that they are gone we can regroup. From now you two will be my children. I'll<br />take care of you two as my own. We will go to the move out of town and head to the capital and start there. I'll bring to light my history with Lucile, the nature of your village. Together we will make peace between our kinds.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>SELENA</h4><p>But we still can't be in the sunlight for too long, and the people will try to have us killed.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ROLAND</h4><p>Not if they think you are my children. I have too much respect for that.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>NICOLAS</h4><p>You do realize that you are about to lose it all when you get honest with the public</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ROLAND</h4><p>Oh I know I'll lose a ton of respect from people with an anti-vampire ideology, but we will gain a new support group. With my big name backing the cause, more people will feel motivated to join us.</p></div><div class="dual-dialogue"><div class="dialogue left"><h4>SELENA</h4><p>Thank you for protecting us.</p></div><div class="dialogue right"><h4>NICOLAS</h4><p>Thank you for protecting us.</p></div></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ROLAND</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">Hugs the orphans</span>)</p><p>Thank you for helping me see things more clearly.</p></div><h3>SCENE V - The Confrontation</h3><p><span class="italic">The curtains open to reveal the stage split in two. On the right side are the woods. Trees and brushes and darkness decorate that side of the stage. On the left-hand side is ROLAND's living room. In the living room are ROLAND STONE, SELENA LOCKWOOD, and NICOLAS LOCKWOOD. On the right-hand side of the stage, FELIX and NADIA enter on their horse.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>NADIA</h4><p>Are you sure this is where they went?</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>FELIX</h4><p>According to my vampire tracker, this is where their scent traveled to.

Let me explain what is going on here.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>NADIA</h4><p>Yeah, what's going on? Because if I weren't mistaken it looks like you're actually protecting these vermin.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ROLAND</h4><p>Well, are you a smart one daughter, I am protecting these children.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>FELIX</h4><p>WHY?! You're supposed to be Roland Stone the legendary vampire hunter? Have you gone senile in your old age? Step aside let me end the lives of those beasts before they harm you and more. They must have drained a lot of your blood which is likely the cause of all this nonsense that you've been spewing.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ROLAND</h4><p>I assure you, I may be old and starting to decay, but I'm still sharp as a tact. Please put your weapons down and let's have a civil conversation.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>FELIX</h4><p>Fine, I'd love to hear the explanation behind my hero committing an act of treason.</p></div><p><span class="italic">FELIX and NADIA drop their weapons.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>ROLAND</h4><p>Everything you two know about me is a lie. I gave up on vampire hunter long into my career. When I met my late wife, a vampire, I learned that those (Makes air quotes with his fingers) monsters, as society puts it, aren't actually heartless beasts. They too are compassionate. Not all of them survive off the blood of humans.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>SELENA</h4><p>That's right! I was trying to tell you guys, but you kept attacking us! We follow the way of the chupacabra and live off of only animal blood.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>FELIX</h4><p>You shut ya mouth! I don't wanna hear from you mutt. Roland! I can't believe what you're saying. When my parents died at the hand of vampires, I built my whole life on your fame. Your reputation was like a father figure to me. You're telling me I built my life on lies?!</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ROLAND</h4><p>I'm sorry for failing to live up to the version of me you had on a pedestal. In reality, all my life I was a coward. I started hunting vampires because I didn't want to deal with the trauma and hurt from my childhood, and when I learned not all vampires are evil monsters, I was too cowardly to publically stand up for them. Well, these kids have helped me understand my late wife more than I did when she was alive. I'm done being a coward. I'm going to stand for what I believe in.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>FELIX</h4><p>I'm gonna turn ya in to the authorities! This is a dangerous ideology! Vampires are heartless killers that can't be trusted.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>SELENA</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">Poking her head from behind ROLAND's back</span>)</p><p>Again you're wrong. Our pack which you two destroyed, for six months settled near that village and never attacked a single human being. We only ever went from cattle on farms with excess cattle and after unclaimed stray animals.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>NADIA</h4><p>So what, you vermin are nothing but glorified mosquitos and need to be crushed like such. You guys are pests.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>NICOLAS</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">Poking his head from ROLAND's back whilst trembling</span>)</p><p>And what makes you humans so different from us? You guys live off the land and drain it of its resources. You cut down forests, and kill whole ecosystems, just so you can live comfortably. All we ever do you go after animals. We do the bare minimum to survive, yet you lump us with vampires that have the human trait of greed and lust for power.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ROLAND</h4><p>The kids make a good point. Don't you two see. Everything we know about the vampires is wrong. There's more nuisance to them.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>FELIX</h4><p>How do ya explain the death of my parents?!</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ROLAND</h4><p>Just like there exist criminals and bad apples among us, it is the same for vampires. Should we really write off an entire group of people because of the sins of a few?</p></div><p><span class="italic">FELIX falls to his knees and begins to start pulling at his hair.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>FELIX</h4><p>I dedicated my life to following a lie.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>NADIA</h4><p>So glad I never looked up to anyone.

I don't care about your cause. Unlike my friend here, I never worshiped the ground you walked on. To be honest I don't really care about the vermin all that much. Sure they killed my parents. But I was so young I barely remember them anyways. All I care about is getting paid so my brothers and I can live comfortably.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ROLAND</h4><p>So, what are you going to do about this? Are you going to expose us to authorities? Are you going to feed the cycle of hatred behind us and the peaceful vampires?</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>NADIA</h4><p>Like I said, old man. I don't care. I'm not completely heartless so I'll keep my mouth shut. But I won't join you. I'm not giving up my life of comfort.</p></div><p><span class="italic">NADIA picks up her weapons and sheaves them back on her person. She starts making her way out the door. ROLAND turns to FELIX.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>ROLAND</h4><p>Son, I know this is a lot for you to take in right now. But please don't try to stop what I want to accomplish. In my old age, I've finally found the courage to fight for what I believe in. Join us, let me undo all the lies that you have learned thanks to people like me. Let me teach you and show you that you, like young me, are wrong about vampires.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>FELIX</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">Starting to come to tears</span>)</p><p>How can I turn my back on this lifestyle? That's all I know. How am I supposed to navigate this?

I don't hold it against you for killing my family, your judgment was clouded by hatred. When I lost all my loved ones, my whole world was turned upside down and I had to learn how to navigate the new position life has placed me. All I had was my brother and I just want to protect and help him live in a world that is so chaotic. I know this is a lot for you. I know when you see me, you see a face similar<br />to the one that took everything from you. But if I care to look at the man that took everything from me and still forgive him, can you be willing to do the same?</p></div><p><span class="italic">With tears in his eyes, FELIX hugs SELENA.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>SELENA CONT.</h4><p>No llores, don't cry Senior.</p></div><p><span class="italic">NADIA walks back into the living room.

Just like you girlie, all I care about is making life easier for my brothers. I'm not as selfless as you. I didn't want to give up my comfortable life. But hearing about how you're learning to navigate life with your brother without your parents, that sounds too much like my story. As I was walking out the door it finally dawned on me, my love of money has made me a cold-hearted monster. I was doing this for my own self-interest and hiding behind my brothers to make my actions look good. So I'm quitting being a vampire hunter. When our bosses don't hear from us, they will assume we died on the battlefield as that's a common occurrence in this line of work. Any living relative of me and Fe will receive money from the government. I'll lose my source of income, but I guess I deserve it for being such a jerk. I'm sorry girlie, sorry little boy. Let me make it up to you by joining you all and being the mother figure that I took away from you.</p></div><p><span class="italic">NADIA breaks down in tears and NICOLAS and SELENA run to embrace her.
