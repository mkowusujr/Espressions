<h3>SCENE 1</h3><p><span class="italic">RICKY walks into a coffee shop at night. There are bags under his eyes. ISABEL is wiping down the register counter, she also has bags under her eyes. The inside of the coffee shop is decorated with warm white walls with dated posters hung up. The floor is decorated with yellow and brown tiles. ISABEL is dressed in a black and gray uniform with her hair tied up in a knot. RICKY is dressed in a fancy brown trench coat, white gloves, and a nice brown hat.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>RICKY</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">Walking up to the counter</span>)</p><p>Evening, I'd like a medium caramel latte with almond milk.</p></div><p><span class="italic">ISABEL puts the wet rag down and changes her gloves. She begins ringing up RICKY's order on the POS system.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>ISABEL</h4><p>Sure thing! Oh my, you look exhausted, are ya having a rough day?</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>RICKY</h4><p>You could definitely say that. Speakina which, you don't look so full of energy ya self.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ISABEL</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">Chuckles</span>)</p><p>What gave me away? Was it my drooping eye bags? And that will be $5.99.</p></div><p><span class="italic">RICKY takes his card out of a stuffed wallet and wipes it on the card reader.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>RICKY</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">chuckles</span>)</p><p>I guess we're in the same boat.</p></div><p><span class="italic">ISABEL watches as the machine prints his receipt and hands it over to him.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>ISABEL</h4><p>If you don't mind my asking, what has been making you so sleep-deprived?</p></div><p><span class="italic">ISABEL grabs a medium plastic cup from a stack of medium plastic cups and puts it on a counter in her workstation.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>RICKY</h4><p>It's family related. Recently I've been put in a position where I have to take on more responsibility than I would like. I was really hoping to become more independent, but it seems like life has other plans. I've spent so many sleepless nights trying to figure out a way out of this but at last, I have nothing.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ISABEL</h4><p>Wow, we really are in the same boat!</p></div><p><span class="italic">ISABEL takes a measuring cup from a rack on the wall and places it on a grounded espresso dispenser. And pushed the button for medium lattes.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>RICKY</h4><p>Really? What's been going on with your situation?</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ISABEL</h4><p>This may surprise you but I don't love my job. I actually wanted to go to school for business but had to give up on that dream when my application was rejected from every school I applied to. Since I had nothing going for me I gave up and accepted my parents' offer to take over the family business.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>RICKY</h4><p>Your parents own this coffee shop?! I've been coming here for years and didn't realize they had a daughter!</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ISABEL</h4><p>Yeah, I don't blame you. I rarely came to my parents' business in broad daylight. Growing up I didn't want the bullies to find out my parents work in customer service. They would never let me hear the end of it. This line of work is embarrassing, I wanted to escape it but here I am, 20 and destined to work food service while others my age and laying the foundations for their high-paying careers.</p></div><p><span class="italic">ISABEL puts the dispensed espresso into the coffee maker and puts the medium plastic up underneath it, and presses the button for medium lattes.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>RICKY</h4><p>I don't get it. How is this line of work embarrassing at your age?</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ISABEL</h4><p>It's cool when you finally turn 16 and first enter the workforce. Most teens start off in this industry. Learning responsibility and work skills. But after a certain point, you have to know to move on to bigger better things. My parents never did. They settled for this, though they had the potential for much better. They settled for this, a job any high schooler can do.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>RICKY</h4><p>Ma'am with all due respect, I think this line of work is good and honorable. It's challenging just like any other high-collar profession. You don't realize how good you have it. I'd switch places with you in a heartbeat. You have a family with a praise-worthy reputation and business.</p></div><p><span class="italic">Ricky looks pensively to the side, regret colors his face.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>ISABEL</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">Chuckles</span>)</p><p>Really? Cause I'd love to take your place. Judging by your appearance, you look like you come from money. You look free.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>RICKY</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">Chuckles</span>)</p><p>An abundance of money isn't always a good thing. Especially when it… comes from… questionable means. Money isn't everything, serving others is. I think it's so rewarding seeing the smiles your work puts on others' faces. I wish my pops felt the same. All he does is order people around all day to handle the dirty work for him.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ISABEL</h4><p>But he earned that though right? When you work hard and reach manager/supervisor status you deserve to rest. You reach such a high place of influence that your word alone accomplishes more than the work of your hands. I want that for myself. I wanted to be the CEO of a large company, not the sole owner and worker of a small coffee shop in some run-down town.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>RICKY</h4><p>Did my pops earn it? He did. He started at the very bottom of the ladder and worked his way out to the very top. There wasn't a thing that he wouldn't do to reach the top. Growing up I wonder if he even had a conscience with all the things he would do to gain status and power. Now he's old and falling apart and wants to hand over the family business to me, his only son. But I don't want it. I want a simple life. I don't want to walk in his shadow any longer than I already have.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ISABEL</h4><p>A wealthy man who wants to leave financial security for a modest life. Now that's something you don't hear every day.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>RICKY</h4><p>You're starting to sound like my old man now.</p></div><p><span class="italic">RICKY and ISABEL share a laugh.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>RICKY CONT.</h4><p>But I get the feeling of not wanting to work in your parents' shadow. Last week my parents retired and gave the keys to the business to me. And they made sure to make a big deal about me taking over by throwing a huge party earlier. So many people now know I'm the daughter of the most hard-working loving people in the whole neighborhood. It's a little overwhelming if I'm honest. Growing up I felt pressure to live up to them behind closed doors; Now that I'm the face of the business, my failures will be broadcasted to an audience bigger than just my parents.</p></div><p><span class="italic">ISABEL grabs a clean metal jug and pours the almond milk she grabbed from the milk into the jug. She heads to the milk steamer and presses the button to auto-clean the machine. She then begins to stream the milk.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>RICKY</h4><p>Mmm… With all that going on in my mind I can see why you don't look too happy to be the new owner of the shop. With all due respect I think you're in a better position than your perspective is allowing you to see. Your parents are kind and honoring folks. You should be proud that that is the legacy that's been laid before you. The business you get to take over has a legacy of bringing smiles, memories, and the much-needed fuel to work the morning shifts for years! Be proud of that.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ISABEL</h4><p>I mean I guess you make a good point. My parents have worked hard to make things more positive in this dumpster of a neighborhood. But I don't want to live in the shadow of their legacy. I'm not them, I'm not as skilled and optimistic, and social as they are. I only reluctantly agreed since I don't have anything else going for me. I figured this is better than nothing as I still need money to live off of.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>RICKY</h4><p>You don't have anything going for you? What do you mean by that?</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ISABEL</h4><p>Look around you, I'm not sure if you noticed but this shop isn't exactly in the best part of town. Money is hard to come by. And money is the only thing that can make you free.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>RICKY</h4><p>You're not entirely correct. In my life, I've seen the love of money create slaves out of free men.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ISABEL</h4><p>Well, I'm not talking about being obsessed with money, just having enough to not be so chained down by society. In this country, if you want to be successful you have to go to university. I wanted to go. I wanted to get out of this dump.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>RICKY</h4><p>I don't blame you. This used to be a nice neighborhood before all the crime moved in. Growing up here must've been rough on you. I'm so sorry, truly I am.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ISABEL</h4><p>You don't have to apologize, you had no role to play in all this (chuckles).</p></div><p><span class="italic">A remorseful expression colors RICKY's face, he opens his mouth to speak but hesitate</span>s</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>ISABEL</h4><p>Besides, I've tried to escape this but life had other plans. I guess I'm stuck in this pitiful coffee shop for the rest of my life.</p></div><p><span class="italic">ISABEL takes the steamed milk and pours it into the plastic cup which currently contains liquid espresso.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>RICKY</h4><p>Surely there are things you enjoy about the work you do? Can the bad things really outweigh the good?</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ISABEL</h4><p>I mean, for the most part, the work is simple and easy. It is pretty fast-paced, but that fits my personality as I'm always in a rush to get things done. I do enjoy getting to show off my multitasking skills. For example, here's your coffee.</p></div><p><span class="italic">ISABEL puts a lid on the latte and hands it to RICKY.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>RICKY</h4><p>Impressive, (<span class="italic">chuckles and receives the cup of coffee from her hands, he proceeds to take the lid off to let the heat out. He then breathes in the aroma of the latte</span>). Wow, for someone who doesn't like her job, you sure are good at it!</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ISABEL</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">Chuckles</span>)</p><p>If you want to keep chatting, maybe we could take a seat at one of the booths? It's closing time so it won't be busy.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>RICKY</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">Smiles</span>)</p><p>I'd love to.</p></div><p><span class="italic">ISABEL moves from behind the counter, taking with her a medium coffee thermos.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>RICKY CONT.</h4><p>I notice you have a drink also. What are you having?</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ISABEL</h4><p>It's an oat milk latte with caramel drizzle. My mother used to make this for me all the time when I was feeling down.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>RICKY</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">Smiles</span>)</p><p>Mothers truly have a gift when it comes to cheering up their children. My mother used to make my spaghetti with walnut sauce after I had had a rough day. It always brought joy to my heart.</p></div><p><span class="italic">The two sit down at a small booth in the corner of the shop.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>ISABEL</h4><p>That's so sweet!</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>RICKY</h4><p>Yeah, I loved my mother. She was the only sane one in the family.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ISABEL</h4><p>Was your father a crazy man growing up?</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>RICKY</h4><p>Crazy, no. A workaholic, yes. He doesn't know what rest is. My pops only has one mode and that was work. No one is perfect, we sure are all messes aren't we? Well, my pops never sees things like that though. That's what made growing up so frustrating. On top of being a workaholic, my pops is a perfectionist. If he asked you to do something, and you were just a centimeter off from his expectations, he'd really let you have it.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ISABEL</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">She covers her mouth in shock</span>)</p><p>Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry to hear that, You definitely had it much worse than I did.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>RICKY</h4><p>Was your pops hard on you in any way growing up?</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ISABEL</h4><p>No actually (<span class="italic">takes a sip of her coffee</span>). He was actually really kind and loving. He never knew when to take a break from work, but that was because he was just trying his hardest to provide for us.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>RICKY</h4><p>He sounds like a nice man.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ISABEL</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">Cracks a gentle smile</span>)</p><p>He is. He gives everything his best and people really love him for it.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>RICKY</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">Smiles and takes a sip of his coffee</span>)</p><p>That's definitely true. There's a reason why I've been coming to Mr. Flamingo's Italian Coffee shop since I was a preteen.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ISABEL</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">Sighs and fiddles with her thermos</span>)</p><p>It's not fair, my parents are literally perfect. Everyone loves them. They can't seem to do anything wrong. Meanwhile, I can't seem to do anything. Today I got 6 orders wrong and had 10 mental breakdowns. I don't want to live in my parents' shadow.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>RICKY</h4><p>I can relate to you. I feel the same way.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ISABEL</h4><p>Really? Do you feel like a total screw-up too?</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>RICKY</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">Smiles and chuckles</span>)</p><p>The biggest screw-up of all time! I'm my pops' firstborn child. Sometimes it feels like I was born in his shadow. Growing up it always felt like I had to live up to his reputation and outdo him in every regard. I was always comparing myself to him. I've done some things I regret trying to please him.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ISABEL</h4><p>Growing up life wasn't hard when I was younger because nothing was expected of me, but as soon as I turned a teenager friends of my family kept comparing me to my parents when they were young. By my age, my parents had accomplished twice as much as I ever had in school, and in sports, heck they were middle school sweethearts. They've never wronged me in any way but sometimes it feels like they set the bar so high. I've become so jaded trying to please everyone and meet the expectations set for me.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>RICKY</h4><p>It's frustrating being compared to others. It feels like bondage.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ISABEL</h4><p>You can say that again, but what exactly can you do about it? You can't exactly change how people think easily.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>RICKY</h4><p>Fair, but why care what others think? I've done things I regret for the sake of pleasing people. I've missed out on the opportunity to be doing what I want and love up until now. I'm not going to be a coward. I'm not going to let people put me in a box.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ISABEL</h4><p>But if you deviate from your father's legacy aren't you afraid of others seeing you as a disappointing version of my parents? That's how I feel about myself. I need to be like them. What choice do I have?</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>RICKY</h4><p>Stop doing that, being hard on yourself. I see too much of myself in you. I'm the same way. You have a choice, don't care what they think. Don't try to please others. Embrace the cards that life gave you and play them to your advantage! That's what I'm going to do.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ISABEL</h4><p>You are making too much sense right now. I guess you're right. I do have a pretty good hand. Maybe I can put my own spin on this coffee shop and make it even more successful. Maybe I can even use some of the things I learned in high school microeconomics to increase our scale of operations!</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>RICKY</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">Smiles</span>)</p><p>Now that's the right attitude.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ISABEL</h4><p>You sure got pretty heated there for a bit. What does your father do? Why was he so hard on you? I noticed you've been pretty vague about what your family does for a living.<br /><span class="italic">RICKY looks to the side pensively and fiddles with his cup. He takes a look at his cup and takes a deep breath. Then he looks back up at ISABEL.</span></p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>RICKY</h4><p>It is best if you don't know my pop's line of work in detail. It's less than honorable, and you don't want to get caught up in it. I've done some things I regret trying to live up to his expectations of me. And I'm done. I was on the fence today, but talking to know has given me the push I need to free myself from my pops business.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ISABEL</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">Slightly shaken, but collects herself</span>)</p><p>You know what, I get it. Whatever you've done I know that's not you. That was you trying to be like your father, you're not your father. You actually have a conscience and feel remorse. And because of that you're already ten times the man he is and your legacy will be an honorable one.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>RICKY</h4><p>Thank you, I really appreciate that.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ISABEL</h4><p>You know we've been talking for a while and I never caught your name.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>RICKY</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">Smiles</span>)</p><p>My names Ricky. Ricardo Miguel Sanchez.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ISABEL</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">Smiles back</span>)</p><p>I'm Isabel. Isabella Katalina Flamingo.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>RICKY</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">With a smug expression</span>)</p><p>Yeah I knew that already, I saw your name-tag.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ISABEL</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">Looks at her name tag and chuckles</span>)</p><p>Don't you wish everybody always wore a name-tag?</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>RICKY</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">Chuckles</span>)</p><p>That would make life easy. Life wouldn't be fun if it were easy.</p></div><p><span class="italic">RICKY's phone rings, he checks it and realizes it is father calling. He takes a deep breath, silences his phone, and begins to get up.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>RICKY</h4><p>Well it's getting late, I need to go take care of business back home, next time you see me I'll be a new man with no regrets. Thank you, you helped me realize some changes I need to make.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>ISABEL</h4><p>The feelings are mutual. We should get a coffee again next time you come. Next time you see me you won't recognize me or what I've done with the place.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>RICKY</h4><p>(<span class="italic">Smiles</span>) I'd like that. I'll be looking forward to both.</p></div><p><span class="italic">The two smile and hug. RICKY walks out of the shop and the curtains close.</span></p>
