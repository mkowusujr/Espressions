<div class="dialogue"><h4>CHARLOTTE</h4><p>I'll wash, you dry.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>THOMAS</h4><p>You sure about that? You washed yesterday, and the day before that, and the day before that. Heck when was the last time you let someone else wash?</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>CHARLOTTE</h4><p>No offense older brother, but you and your little sister are terrible dishwashers. You two always miss a spot and leave oil stained on the supposedly washed dishes.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>KANSAS</h4><p>I'm still a kid and learning how to wash dishes, big bro. You're a whole grown man. What's your excuse?</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>THOMAS</h4><p>Why are you two tagging up on me all of a sudden?</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>CHARLOTTE</h4><p>Oh, get over yourself. I told you not to take often to what I was going to say. Just take care of drying the dishes. You pretty good at that</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>THOMAS</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">Sighs</span>)</p><p>Fine. Gimmie those. (<span class="italic">Grabs a dray rag and extends his arm to receive the dish that CHARLOTTE just finished washing</span>).</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>KANSAS</h4><p>I can't believe we got promoted to this big unit. We have our own kitchenette now! We don't have to eat in that cold gloomy dining hall anymore. This game is so much fun. All we have to do is just go pew pew pew and we get big rewards</p></div><p><span class="italic">THOMAS looks over at KANSAS who is planning with crayons and paper, a look of concern paints his face.</span></p><p><span class="italic">CHARLOTTE notices the look on his face and whispers to him.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>CHARLOTTE</h4><p>You think she'll turn out okay?</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>THOMAS</h4><p>Huh? What do you mean by that? Are you talking about Kansas?</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>CHARLOTTE</h4><p>Duh. I see the way you look at her when she talks. I see you look at my the same way during missions too.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>THOMAS</h4><p>I-, it's just-</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>CHARLOTTE</h4><p>I get it. I worry about us too. I'm well aware that war is no place for children, no matter how gifted we are. That's why I look forward to finally defeating our nation's enemies so we can finally be diminished and live normal lives. (smiles)</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>THOMAS</h4><p>What will happen to us, to me and Kansas, will you remember us?</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>KANSAS</h4><p>Of course big brother. In my dreams, we all share an apartment, pretty similar to this one. I want us to always be in each other's lives. You guys are the good thing I have.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>THOMAS</h4><p>Same here. Which is why I worry about you guys. I don't want you guys to get messed up in the head.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>CHARLOTTE</h4><p>That's what training is for. There is nothing on the battlefield that we have seen worse in the simulations we've done.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>THOMAS</h4><p>That's true. But still, look at what it's doing to you guys. Look at what it's doing to me.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>CHARLOTTE</h4><p>Its making us more efficeint soliders. Isn't that the point? The more efficient we are the sooner we can go home. Isn't that what we want? I know you want to leave this place as much as I do.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>THOMAS</h4><p>That's not what I'm trying to get to. What I'm trying to say is that these simulations, this military base, this war. It's stripping us of our humanity. We are being turned into cold heartless killers. I can't even recognize ourselves on the battlefield. We are like heartless beasts.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>CHARLOTTE</h4><p>Humanity?</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>THOMAS</h4><p>Yes, our humanity. Who can you live a normal life, if you lose touch with your humanity?</p></div><p><span class="italic">CHARLOTTE stops washing the dishes for a moment to contemplate her life, she notices that her arms are still reddish despite how many times she washes herself. Bloodstained on her flesh.</span></p><p><span class="italic">KANSAS overhears the conversations.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>KANSAS</h4><p>What are you going on about big bro? This is just a game, lighten up. Those aren't really people we are killing. They are just NPC's in the simulation.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>THOMAS</h4><p class="parenthetical">(<span class="italic">Puts the dish he is currently wiping dry down</span>)</p><p>Kansas. I'm sorry, but this is not a game.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>KANSAS</h4><p>You keep saying that, but Father keeps saying otherwise.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>THOMAS</h4><p>Father? Do you mean Doctor Spekstiens?</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>KANSAS</h4><p>Yeah, father.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>THOMAS</h4><p>That man is not our father.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>CHARLOTTE</h4><p>What do you mean? He has been raising us since we were young.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>THOMAS</h4><p>That monster doesn't care about us. Everything we see him, it's in the lab and he is just running tests on us.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>KANSAS</h4><p>He just wants to make sure we are doing okay, he is usually busy with work that all. Daddy is a busy man</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>CHARLOTTE</h4><p>Hmm</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>THOMAS</h4><p>Charlotte, come on, tell me you don't notice what the doctor is up to. He is no father.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>CHARLOTTE</h4><p>Kansas, why do you call the doctor our father?</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>KANSAS</h4><p>That's what he tells me to call him. He doesn't say that to you too?</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>CHARLOTTE</h4><p>Not since I was your age... I haven't thought about or called him that in almost a decade. If anything I've always seen big brother as a father figure. He is the one that cares about me and takes me. Not that doctor. He. He is my least favorite thing about this place.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>KANSAS</h4><p>What are you two going on about?</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>THOMAS</h4><p>That's it. I can't let this keep going on. It's time I tell you guys what's really happening here.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>CHARLOTTE</h4><p>What do you mean?</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>THOMAS</h4><p>We aren't ever getting out of this place. Not even after the war is over.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>CHARLOTTE</h4><p>But that's what our superiors keep telling us. Work hard and when the war is over our time will be up and we will be free to go.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>KANSAS</h4><p>Yeah. Uncles said that when the game is over we can go home and rest.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>THOMAS</h4><p>Those people are not our family. We are their hostages. They kidnapped us. They experimented on us.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>KANSAS</h4><p>Huh?! You're sounding like a crazy old man big bro</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>CHARLOTTE</h4><p>No, he's not Kansas. Stop for a second. Tell me you don't see the suspicious way the people you call father and uncles have been acting.</p></div><p><span class="italic">KANSAS remains silent.</span></p><div class="dialogue"><h4>CHARLOTTE</h4><p>I think I remember why I stopped calling them family. Cause they wiped those memories away. I wasn't born here. I remember now. I was taken from my home.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>THOMAS</h4><p>Looks like I triggered a core memory.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>KANSAS</h4><p>This is not my home...? (<span class="italic">Kansas still to put two and two together. Her world is being shattered</span>)</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>CHARLOTTE</h4><p>What are we going to do big brother? If they find out we remember, won't they just wipe our minds again</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>THOMAS</h4><p>Not if we break out.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>CHARLOTTE</h4><p>What about Kansas?</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>KANSAS</h4><p>I'm in.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>CHARLOTTE</h4><p>Did a switch flip in your head? YOure acting different</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>KANSAS</h4><p>I just realized that the NPC's I've been killing are real people and that the family I have is all in my imagination. I want out of this place as soon as possible. I also want a therapist.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>CHARLOTTE</h4><p>Me too.</p></div><div class="dialogue"><h4>THOMAS</h4><p>Me three.</p></div><p><span class="italic">They all laugh.</span></p>
